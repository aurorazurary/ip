# Use of AI Tools in iP Development

## Tools Used
- **Claude**
- **Incremet used for:** A-BetterGui

**Task:** Implement custom visual styling for JavaFX GUI
- CSS styling for text fields and buttons
- Layout anchoring for responsive resizing

**What worked:**
- AI provided step-by-step CSS solutions for applying custom speech bubble images as background
- Added proper gap spacing between TextField and Button using AnchorPane constraints
- Helped debug

**What didn't work:**
- It doesn't space properly by itself
- Failed to debug why locally downloaded font file didn't load

**Challenges encountered:**
- ScrollPane viewport covering background image - required making viewport transparent
- It kept telling me to inject css styles directly to the java program, which violates the basic principles of design

**Time saved:**
- Estimated 2-3 hours saved on CSS debugging and JavaFX styling documentation lookup
- Would have required extensive reading of JavaFX CSS documentation otherwise

**Special note:**
This original script was also written by Claude, with some edits I made after
